Operation instructions: Turn on the camera or signal source, turn ON MVC device, turn on the connected recorder or monitor, and observe the video signal from the signal source propagates to the display

Troubleshooting MVC
Issue: When a 4K camera is connected to the MVC using four BNC cables, the output displays as 4 identical 2x2 images. Possible Cause: There might be a mismatch between the camera's output type and the MVC's firmware type (Quad vs 2SI). Solutions:


Check if your camera permits changing the video split type. This can typically be adjusted either through the device's menu settings or by using the DIP switch.

If the camera's video split type is fixed and cannot be altered, you will need to replace the MVC device with one that has compatible firmware. Specifically, a Quad camera output should be matched with an MVC device with Quad firmware, and a 2SI output should be paired with a 2SI firmware.


Issue: A horizontal or vertical center line appears on the video output of the MVC after some time. Possible Cause: There might be a loss of synchronization between the four BNC cables. Solutions:


Restart the MVC device by turning the power off and then back on.

If the issue continues to occur repeatedly, inspect the BNC cable connections and replace any BNC cables if necessary.

Ensure that all four BNC cables are of the same type and length. This can prevent potential discrepancies in signal transmission and synchronization.
